# How To Run

## Environment To Run

I verified this project coudld run on below env:

+ pnpm: Version 9.2.0
+ nodejs: v20.9.0

## Command To Run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```

Then it will launch `http://localhost:9003/` in your default browser, and that's where my demo video start from.
